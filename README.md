# Machine Learning ITMO IS Labs Repository
This repository contains solutions and datasets for multiple ITMO IS ML labs focused on different tasks such as data parsing, unsupervised and supervised learning, image/audio processing, and generative models.

## Web Crawling & Parsing
A web crawler is implemented to scrape and parse data from a selected website, resulting in a dataset that includes both categorical and quantitative variables. The dataset is intended for further analysis and model training in subsequent labs.

## Supervised Learning
The dataset from Lab 1 is preprocessed for supervised learning tasks. A baseline model is established and fine-tuned with selected machine learning algorithms to predict a target variable. Key steps include hyperparameter tuning and evaluation of model performance.

## Unsupervised Learning
The same dataset is used to explore clustering techniques such as k-means and DBSCAN. The focus is on dimensionality reduction and model evaluation, comparing the performance of baseline and custom implementations.

## Image Classification
A dataset of images is collected, processed, and used to train a CNN model for various image classification tasks. Transfer learning techniques are also applied using pretrained models.

## Audio Classification
An audio dataset is collected, and a model is trained to classify audio features using techniques like LSTM and CNN. Audio pre-processing and embedding visualization are included.

## Generative Model
A generative model is trained to create new data samples based on a given dataset, focusing on latent space interpolation and model evaluation.

This repo showcases a variety of ML techniques and workflows aimed at solving real-world tasks, from crawling and parsing to generative model development.
